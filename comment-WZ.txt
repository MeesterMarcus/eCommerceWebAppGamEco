The ER diagram around Transactions need to be revised. 
Basically, those 3-way relationships have problems.

A transaction is a strong entity with a unique key.
A transaction is Approved by a Manager, Handled by a Rep, 
Contains one or more Games, and is Placed by a Customer.
These are 4 binary relationships.

There are also some issues with the normalization. For example,
the Person table has FDs:

ZipCode,State -> City
ID -> Status,FirstName,LastName,DOB_Day,DOB_Month,DOB_Year, Phone#, Street

1) What about ID -> ZipCode,State, City ?
2) Given the above FDs, why is the table BCNF or 3NF? 
Is {ZipCode, state} a super key, or City a part of a candidate key?
