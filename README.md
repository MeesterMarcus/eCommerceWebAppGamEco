Setup:

1. Get XAMPP running
2. Go to phpmyadmin
3. Create a database named Mydb6
4. Go to Mydb6 link
5. Go to import and import the sql file in the sql folder
6. Go to localhost/gameco

NOTES:

*Final and midpoint reports are in Report folder in both pdf and docx.

*Manager should already be available to login when the Mydb6.sql file is imported. 

username: manager@yahoo.com 
password: manager

*Access physical database by going to localhost/phpmyadmin

*In folder backup there is a folder called bootstrap which was our 
 attempt to make the website look nice and more responsive as well as mobile friendly.
 We had problems with the bootstrap modals and getting some of the php to work.
 
*There have been some issues running the web application on servers other than XAMPP. 
 
 *On Windows 7 and Mac, as a manager, when you submit a new game the image should pop up fine. Made it so that when you browse for the image it will create the right path to the folder b/c the html file input only gets the image name and not the path. Although, when running on Windows 8 as manager, when you submit a game and browse for an image it will give the fullpath  and not just the image name so the path will be messed up. Also the image has to be in the folder for it show up on the website.
